## Pseudocode

// 1) Define the required variables used to track the state of the game.

// 2) Store cached element references.

// 3) Upon loading, the game state should be initialized, and a function should
// be called to render this game state.

// 4) The state of the game should be rendered to the user.

// 5) Handle the game over logic.

// 6) Handle each instance of a player clicking a button with the use of a
// `handleClick()` function.

// 7) Create reset functionality.
