## Pseudocode

1) Define the required variables used to track the state of the game.

2) Store cached element references.

3) Upon loading, the game state should be initialized, and a function should
be called to render this game state.

4) The state of the game should be rendered to the user.

5) Handle the game over logic.

6) Handle each instance of a player clicking a button with the use of a
`handleClick()` function.

7) Create reset functionality.
