## About
The classic late 90's sensation "Tamagotchi Pet" revamped and simplified featuring a poorly drawn egg with a sassy demeanor.

## Getting Started
All you have to do is keep your pet from being bored, hungry or sleepy by pressing the buttons for each. Keep them low or better yet at zero and your egg pet will be fine. If it goes over ten the egg dies from being too spoiled!

## Next Steps
Next major steps following in true modern triple A game fashion will be microtransactions! I would also like to make the game timer go on for longer like a traditional Tamagotchi pet and give the UI a more modern look and possible port to a mobile version that can be used as a widget! I also would like to add some cool new features like a job feature where your pet earns money at a job they work at which 2x speeds the rate of sleepiness. The money the pet earns could be used to buy upgraded items to put on the avatar!
